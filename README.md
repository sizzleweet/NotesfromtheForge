# Readme
Notes from the Forge is a starter vault for Obsidian used to play Ironsworn: Starforged.

This project is heavily borrowed from AND inspired by [Forged in Obsidian](https://github.com/ericbright2002/Forged_in_Obsidian)

Thanks a ton Eric Bright for your help along the way.

Other big shoutouts go to [Shawn Tomkin](https://linktr.ee/shawntomkin) the creator of [Ironsworn](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/) and [Josh Meehan](https://joshmeehanart.com/) for his incredible artwork

# Release Notes

## v0.1.0
- Initial release
- I've play tested with the vault for a while and have been finding it pretty useful.  I'm considering this the beta phase.  Please don't hesitate to open issues or ping me on the Ironsworn discord.


# Instructions

- Download files and open the vault in Obsidian.  
- The main instructions on using the vault are contained in the [[Manual]]. 
- It works much better opening that from within obsidian due to the image and callout formatting etc.


# Still to do:

- Add all the oracles to the mix. I'll eventually have them all in there so you can roll on them in your journal or whatever.
- I want to create a first look NPC, planet, settlement generator like in [stargazer](https://nboughton.uk/apps/stargazer/#/)
- Play the game at some point... that'd be neat too.

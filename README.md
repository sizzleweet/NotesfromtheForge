# Readme
Notes from the Forge is a starter vault for Obsidian used to play Ironsworn: Starforged.

This project is heavily borrowed from AND inspired by [Forged in Obsidian](https://github.com/ericbright2002/Forged_in_Obsidian)

Thanks a ton Eric Bright for your help along the way.

Other big shoutouts go to [Shawn Tomkin](https://linktr.ee/shawntomkin) the creator of [Ironsworn](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/) and [Josh Meehan](https://joshmeehanart.com/) for his incredible artwork (see the license file for more details.

# Release Notes

## v0.1.0
- Initial release
- I've play tested with the vault for a while and have been finding it pretty useful.  I'm considering this the beta phase.  Please don't hesitate to open issues or ping me on the Ironsworn discord.


# Instructions

Download files and open in Obsidian.  The main instructions on using the vault are contained in the "Manual" document.  It works much better opening that from within obsidian due to the image and callout formatting etc.

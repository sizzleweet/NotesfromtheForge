# Backstory

Someone in my family played an important part in the great war.  They were somehow involved in the cataclysm that sent us here.  I don't know why or how.

Because of this our family is outcast.  

I joined the Keepers to try to bring back honor to our family name, to prove myself to someone or something.

I did my time in the keepers.  Witnessing (participating in) horrific injustices carried out in the name of the Covenant left me jaded against the major factions.  

Now I'm on my own.  Part of me knows I need to make up for my past so I'll look for a way to redeem myself... whatever that means. 

All I know is that I'm going to fly free no matter what.

I own a bot called the Electronic Activity Noise Relay, Eleanor for short, which is an AI I can chat with at all times.

I also have a Multi-purpose Utility Bot named MuBu.

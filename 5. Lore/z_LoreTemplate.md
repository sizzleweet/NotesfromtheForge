# Weave

- A network of data hubs which allow near-instantaneous communication and data-sharing between ships and outposts.
- Relies on a series of [[Weave Hub|Weave Hubs]] to operate.
- Mostly found in sectors residing in the terminus.
- Beyond the most populous sectors, travelers and outposts are still commonly isolated and entirely off the grid.
- Efforts are currently being made to expand the Weave to the Outlands and beyond.

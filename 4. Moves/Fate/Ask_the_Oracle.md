# Ask the Oracle

**When you seek to resolve questions, reveal details, discover locations, determine how other characters respond, or trigger encounters or events**, you may...

  * Draw a conclusion: Decide the answer based on the most interesting and obvious result.
  * Spark an idea: Use an oracle table or other random prompt.
  * Ask a yes/no question: Decide the odds of a yes, and roll on the table below to check the answer.
  * Pick two: Envision two options. Rate one as likely, and roll on the table below to see if it is true. If not, it is the other.

Odds           | The answer is yes if you roll...
---------------|---------------------------------
Small Chance   | 10 or less
Unlikely       | 25 or less
50/50          | 50 or less
Likely         | 75 or less

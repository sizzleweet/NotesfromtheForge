# Face Death

**When you encounter a situation where death is an immediate and unavoidable outcome**, you are dead. **When you are instead brought to the brink of death with a chance for recovery or redemption**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, you are cast back into the mortal world.

On a **weak hit**, choose one.

  * You die, but not before making a noble sacrifice. Envision your final moments.
  * There is more to be done. Envision what is revealed or asked of you at death's door, and [Swear an Iron Vow](Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to complete an extreme quest. You return to the mortal world and must mark **doomed**. When you complete the deathbound quest, clear the impact.

On a **miss**, you are dead.

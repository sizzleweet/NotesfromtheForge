# Face Desolation

**When you are brought to the brink of desolation**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, you resist and press on.

On a **weak hit**, choose one.

  * Your spirit breaks, but not before you make a noble sacrifice. Envision your final moments.
  * You see a vision of a dreaded event coming to pass. Envision that dark future, and [Swear an Iron Vow](Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to prevent it through an extreme quest. You return to your senses and must mark **tormented**. When you complete the soul-bound quest, clear the impact.

On a **miss**, you succumb to despair or horror and are lost.

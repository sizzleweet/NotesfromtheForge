# Take Decisive Action

*Progress Move*

**When you seize an objective in a fight**, envision how you take decisive action. Then, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

If you are in control, check the result as normal. If you are in a bad spot, count a strong hit without a match as a weak hit, and a weak hit as a miss.

On a **strong hit**, you prevail. Take +1 momentum. If any objectives remain and the fight continues, you are in control.

On a **weak hit**, you achieve your objective, but not without cost. Roll on the table below or choose one. If the fight continues, you are in a bad spot.

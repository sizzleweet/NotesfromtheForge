# Battle

**When you fight a battle and it happens in a blur**, envision your objective and roll. If you primarily...

  * Fight at range, or using your speed and the environment to your advantage: Roll +edge.
  * Fight depending on your courage, leadership, or companions: Roll +heart.
  * Fight in close to overpower your foe: Roll +iron.
  * Fight using trickery to befuddle your foe: Roll +shadow.
  * Fight using careful tactics to outsmart your foe: Roll +wits.

On a **strong hit**, you achieve your objective unconditionally. You and any allies who joined the battle may take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you achieve your objective, but not without cost. [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

On a **miss**, you are defeated or the objective is lost. [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

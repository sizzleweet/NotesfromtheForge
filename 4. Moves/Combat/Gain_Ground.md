# Gain Ground

**When you are in control and take action in a fight to reinforce your position or move toward an objective**, envision your approach and roll. If you are...

  * In pursuit, fleeing, or maneuvering: Roll +edge
  * Charging boldly into action, coming to the aid of others, negotiating, or commanding: Roll +heart
  * Gaining leverage with force, powering through, or making a threat: Roll +iron
  * Hiding, preparing an ambush, or misdirecting: Roll +shadow
  * Coordinating a plan, studying a situation, or cleverly gaining leverage: Roll +wits

On a **hit**, you stay in control. On a **strong hit**, choose two. On a **weak hit**, choose one.

  * Mark progress
  * Take +2 momentum
  * Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)

On a **miss**, your foe gains the upper hand, the fight moves to a new location, or you encounter a new peril. You are in a bad spot and must [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

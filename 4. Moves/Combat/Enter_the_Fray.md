# Enter the Fray

**When you initiate combat or are forced into a fight**, envision your objective and give it a rank. If the combat includes discrete challenges or phases, set an objective with a rank for each.

Then, roll to see if you are in control. If you are...

  * On the move: Roll +edge
  * Facing off against your foe: Roll +heart
  * In the thick of it at close quarters: Roll +iron
  * Preparing to act against an unaware foe: Roll +shadow
  * Caught in a trap or sizing up the situation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, take both. On a **weak hit**, choose one.

  * Take +2 momentum
  * You are in control

On a **miss**, the fight begins with you in a bad spot.

# React Under Fire

**When you are in a bad spot and take action in a fight to avoid danger or overcome an obstacle**, envision your approach and roll. If you are...

  * In pursuit, fleeing, dodging, getting back into position, or taking cover: Roll +edge
  * Remaining stalwart against fear or temptation: Roll +heart
  * Blocking or diverting with force, or taking the hit: Roll +iron
  * Moving into hiding or creating a distraction: Roll +shadow
  * Changing the plan, finding a way out, or cleverly bypassing an obstacle: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, you succeed and are in control. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you avoid the worst of the danger or overcome the obstacle, but not without a cost. Make a [suffer move](#Suffer-Moves) (-1). You stay in a bad spot.

On a **miss**, the situation worsens. You stay in a bad spot and must [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

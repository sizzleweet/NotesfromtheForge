# Take a Break

**When you resolve a progress move or complete an intense scenario**, take a few deep breaths and take some time to attend to the needs of your body. Reflect on what just happened and how it made you feel. Then, choose one.

  * Move on: Continue the session. You or an ally may add +1 on the next move (not a progress move), bolstered by your reflection and past experiences.
  * Stop for now: [End a Session](Moves/Session/End_a_Session).

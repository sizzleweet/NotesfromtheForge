# End a Session

**When you end a significant session or chapter of play**, reflect on the events of the game and identify any missed opportunities to mark progress.

  * If you strengthened your ties to a connection, [Develop Your Relationship](Moves/Connection/Develop_Your_Relationship).
  * If you moved forward on a quest, [Reach a Milestone](Moves/Quest/Reach_a_Milestone).

If there is a quest, connection, or other situation you would like to give focus in your next session, make note of it and take +1 momentum.

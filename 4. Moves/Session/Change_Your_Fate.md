# Change Your Fate

**When you encounter flagged content, reject an oracle, resist a consequence, or otherwise need to shift your circumstances within the game for your comfort or enjoyment**, pause and identify what needs to be changed. Choose as many options as appropriate.

  * **Reframe:** This didnâ€™t happen the way you first thought. Envision the moment from another perspective in a way that diminishes or changes the content.
  * **Refocus:** This is not the most important thing happening right now. Envision how the spotlight shifts to change the focus.
  * **Replace:** This happens but with a small adjustment. Switch out an element and envision how this new detail changes the scenario.
  * **Redirect:** Adjust the trajectory to involve a helping hand. Envision how another person or party becomes involved.
  * **Reshape:** The situation changes completely. Envision what happened instead.

# Begin a Session

**When you begin a significant session or chapter of play**, do all of the following.

  * Identify or adjust flagged content and [Set a Flag](Moves/Session/Set_a_Flag).
  * Review or recap what happened last session.
  * Set the scene by envisioning your character’s current situation and intent.

In addition, you may spotlight a new danger, opportunity, or insight. This can include a scene hidden from your character’s perspective. If you do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or choose on the table below for inspiration). Then, all players take +1 momentum as you return to play from the viewpoint of your characters.

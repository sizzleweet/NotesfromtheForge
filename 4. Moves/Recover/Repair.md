# Repair

**When you make repairs to your vehicles, modules, mechanical companions, or other devices**, envision the situation and roll. If you...

  * Make your own repairs, or direct a companion to make repairs: Roll +wits
  * Obtain repairs from someone (not an ally): Roll +supply

On a **hit**, you gain repair points as appropriate to the situation, per the table below. Additionally, you may [Sacrifice Resources](Moves/Suffer/Sacrifice_Resources) and exchange each _1 of supply for 1 extra repair point (up to 3 points).

Situation     | Strong Hit | Weak Hit
--------------|------------|---------
At a facility | 5 points   | 3 points
In the field  | 3 points   | 1 points
Under fire    | 2 points   | 0 points

Spend repair points as follows. Unused points are discarded.

  * Clear the battered impact on a vehicle: 2 points
  * Fix one broken module: 2 points
  * Take +1 integrity on a vehicle: 1 point
  * Take +1 health for a mechanical companion: 1 point
  * Repair any other device: 3 points
  * Repair any other device, but with a complication or malfunction: 2 points

On a **miss**, the repairs are not made and the situation worsens. [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

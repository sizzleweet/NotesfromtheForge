# Resupply

**When you attempt to bolster your readiness**, envision the opportunity and your approach. If you...

  * Barter or make an appeal: Roll +heart
  * Threaten or seize: Roll +iron
  * Steal or swindle: Roll +shadow
  * Scavenge or craft: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

  * If you are unprepared, clear the impact and take +1 supply. Otherwise, take +2 supply.
  * If you are in need of a specific item or resource that can reasonably be obtained, you acquire it. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but you must first deal with a cost, complication, or demand. Envision the nature of this obstacle.

On a **miss**, you encounter an unexpected peril. [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

# Hearten

**When you socialize, share intimacy, or find a moment of peace**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, you find companionship or comfort and your spirit is strengthened. If you are shaken, clear the impact and take +1 spirit. Otherwise, take +2 spirit. If you make this move as you [Sojourn](Moves/Recover/Sojourn), take +1 more.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but this indulgence is fleeting. Envision an interruption, complication, or inner conflict. Then, [Lose Momentum](Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-1).

On a **miss**, you take no comfort and the situation worsens. [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

# Swear an Iron Vow

**When you swear upon iron to complete a quest**, write your vow and give it a rank. Then, roll +heart. If you swear this vow to a connection, add +1; if you share a bond, add +2.

On a **strong hit**, you are emboldened and it is clear what you must do next. Take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you are determined but begin your quest with more questions than answers. Take +1 momentum, and envision what you do to find a path forward.

On a **miss**, you must overcome a significant obstacle before you begin your quest. Envision what stands in your way.

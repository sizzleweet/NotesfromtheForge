# Fulfill Your Vow

*Progress Move*

**When you reach the end of your quest**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit**, your vow is fulfilled. Mark a reward on your quests legacy track per the vow's rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who shared this vow also mark the reward.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but there is more to be done or you realize the truth of your quest. If you [Swear an Iron Vow](Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to set things right, take your full legacy reward. Otherwise, make the reward one rank lower.

On a **miss**, your vow is undone through an unexpected complication or realization. Envision what happens and choose one.

  * Give up on the quest: [Forsake Your Vow](Moves/Quest/Forsake_Your_Vow).
  * Recommit to the quest: Roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the vow's rank by one (if not already epic).

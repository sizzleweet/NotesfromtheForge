# Set a Course

**When you follow a known route through perilous space, across hazardous terrain, or within a mysterious site**, roll +supply.

On a **strong hit**, you reach your destination and the situation there favors you. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you arrive, but face a cost or complication. Choose one.

  * Suffer costs en route: Make a [suffer move](#Suffer-Moves) (-2), or two [suffer moves](#Suffer-Moves) (-1).
  * Face a complication at the destination: Envision what you encounter.

On a **miss**, you are waylaid by a significant threat, and must [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price). If you overcome this obstacle, you may push on safely to your destination.

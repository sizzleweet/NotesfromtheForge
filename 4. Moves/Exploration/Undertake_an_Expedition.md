# Undertake an Expedition

**When you trailblaze a route through perilous space, journey over hazardous terrain, or survey a mysterious site**, give the expedition a name and rank. Then, for each segment of the expedition, envision your approach. If you...

  * Move at speed: Roll +edge
  * Keep under the radar: Roll +shadow
  * Stay vigilant: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, you reach a waypoint. Envision the location and mark progress per the rank of the expedition.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but this progress costs you. Choose one.

  * Suffer costs en route: Make a [suffer move](#Suffer-Moves) (-2), or two [suffer moves](#Suffer-Moves) (-1).
  * Face a peril at the waypoint: Envision what you encounter.

On a **miss**, you are waylaid by a crisis, or arrive at a waypoint to confront an immediate hardship or threat. Do not mark progress, and [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

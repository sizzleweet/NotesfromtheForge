# Begin the Scene

**When you face an extended or complex challenge outside of a fight**, name your objective and set its rank as formidable.

Then, envision the situation and choose the number of segments for the sceneâ€™s tension clock.

  * You are severely disadvantaged: Four segments
  * You are on equal footing: Six segments
  * You have strong advantage: Eight segments

When the clock is full, you must [Finish the Scene](Moves/Scene_Challenge/Finish_the_Scene).

# Face Danger (Scene Challenge)

**When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat within a scene challenge**, envision your action and roll. If you act...

  * With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
  * With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
  * With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
  * With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
  * With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, you are successful and mark progress. On a **strong hit with a match**, mark progress twice.

On a **weak hit**, you are successful and mark progress, but also encounter a complication or setback. Envision what occurs and fill a clock segment.

On a **miss**, you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dramatic turn of events. Fill a clock segment and [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price). On a **miss with a match**, fill two segments and [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

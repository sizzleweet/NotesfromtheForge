# Finish the Scene

**When the scene challenge tension clock or progress track is filled, or when events lead to the sceneâ€™s conclusion**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit**, you achieve your objective unconditionally.

On a **weak hit**, you succeed, but not without cost. You must [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price). Make this a minor cost relative to the scope of the scene.

On a **miss**, you fail or are undermined by a dire and costly turn of events. [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

# Secure an Advantage

**When you assess a situation, make preparations, or attempt to gain leverage**, envision your action and roll. If you act...

  * With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
  * With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
  * With strength, endurance, aggression: Roll +iron
  * With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
  * With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **hit**, you succeed. On a **strong hit**, take both. On a **weak hit**, choose one.

  * Take +2 momentum
  * Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)

On a **miss**, you fail or your assumptions betray you. [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

**When you try to persuade someone or make them an offer**, envision your approach. If you...

  * Charm, pacify, encourage, or barter: Roll +heart
  * Threaten or incite: Roll +iron
  * Lie or swindle: Roll +shadow

On a **strong hit**, they'll do what you want or agree to your conditions. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but their agreement comes with a demand or complication. Envision their counteroffer.

On a **miss**, they refuse or make a demand that costs you greatly. [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

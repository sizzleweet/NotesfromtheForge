# Face Danger

**When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat**, envision your action and roll. If you act...

  * With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
  * With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
  * With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
  * With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
  * With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, you are successful. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you succeed, but not without a cost. Make a [suffer move](#Suffer-Moves) (-1).

On a **miss**, you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dire turn of events. [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

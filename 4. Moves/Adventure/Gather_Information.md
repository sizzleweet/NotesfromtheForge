# Gather Information

**When you search for clues, conduct an investigation, analyze evidence, or do research**, roll +wits.

On a **strong hit**, you discover something helpful and specific. The path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is made clear. Envision what you learn. Then, take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, the information provides new insight, but also complicates your quest. Envision what you discover. Then, take +1 momentum.

On a **miss**, your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an unwelcome truth that undermines your quest. [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

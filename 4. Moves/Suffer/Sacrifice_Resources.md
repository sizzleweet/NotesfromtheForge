# Sacrifice Resources

**When you lose or consume resources**, suffer -1 supply for a minor loss, -2 for a serious loss, or -3 for a major loss.

If your supply is exhausted (reduced to 0), mark **unprepared**. When you suffer a loss of resources while unprepared, envision how this causes you hardship and apply the cost to a different suffer move.

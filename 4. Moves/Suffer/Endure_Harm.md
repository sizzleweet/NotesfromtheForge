# Endure Harm

**When you face physical injury, fatigue, or illness**, suffer -1 health for minor harm, -2 for serious harm, or -3 for major harm. If your health is 0, [Lose Momentum](Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) equal to any remaining harm.

Then, if your health is 0 or you choose to resist the harm, roll +health or +iron, whichever is higher.

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

  * Shake it off: If you are not wounded, take +1 health
  * Embrace the pain: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit**, if you are not wounded, you may [Lose Momentum](Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-1) in exchange for +1 health. Otherwise, press on.

On a **miss**, itâ€™s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 health or [Lose Momentum](Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2). If your health is 0, you must also mark wounded or permanently harmed, or roll on the table below.

# Lose Momentum

**When you are delayed or disadvantaged**, suffer -1 momentum for a minor setback, -2 for a serious setback, or -3 for a major setback.

When your momentum is at its minimum (-6) and you must suffer -momentum, choose one.

  * Envision how the price is paid and apply the cost to a different suffer move.
  * Envision how this undermines your progress on a vow, expedition, connection, or combat. Then, clear 1 unit of progress on that track per its rank: troublesome=3 boxes; dangerous=2 boxes; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 ticks; epic=1 tick.

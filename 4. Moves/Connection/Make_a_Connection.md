# Make a Connection

**When you search out a new relationship or give focus to an existing relationship (not an ally or companion)**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, you create a connection. Give them a role and rank. Whenever your connection aids you on a move closely associated with their role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but this connection comes with a complication or cost. Envision what they reveal or demand.

On a **miss**, you don't make a connection and the situation worsens. [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).

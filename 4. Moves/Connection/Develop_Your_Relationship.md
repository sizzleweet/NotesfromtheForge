# Develop Your Relationship

**When you reinforce your relationship with a connection** by doing any of the following...

  * swearing a vow to undertake a perilous quest in their service
  * completing a quest to their benefit
  * leveraging their help in desperate circumstances
  * giving them something of worth
  * sharing a profound moment
  * standing with them against hardship
  * overcoming a test of your relationship

...you may mark progress per the rank of the connection.

If you already share a bond with the connection, do not mark progress. Instead, roll +their rank to learn the impact on your legacy: troublesome=+1; dangerous=+2; formidable=+3; extreme=+4; epic=+5. 

On a **strong hit**, mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track. On a **strong hit with a match**, you may also envision how recent events bolstered your connectionâ€™s standing and raise their rank by one (if not already epic). 

On a **weak hit**, take +2 momentum. 

On a **miss**, take no lasting benefit.
